# directus-extension-1to1-interface

This directus interface provides an inline 1:1 interface.
Install the extension, create a new field and select the 1:1 Interface.
In the configuration select the collection you would like to create a relation to.

This interface also works with singletons on either end (or both ends) of the 1:1 interface.
